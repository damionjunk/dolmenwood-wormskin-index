# dolmenwood-wormskin-index

A hopefully helpful index into all of the [Wormskin](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/231189/Everything-Dolmenwood-PDF-BUNDLE) zines. 

## Whats Here?

The document `dwi.md` is just a Markdown file with names of useful bits from all of the zines along with which issue it appeared in and a page number or page range.

For example:

```
- Psychedelic Compounds; ws2 p5-16
```

A Psychedelic Compounds generator can be found in Wormskin 2, on pages 5 through 16.
